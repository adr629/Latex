	abstract = {This paper describes applications of artificial intelligence to estimate indoor carbon dioxide levels, even in the absence of a direct CO2 sensor, based on simply obtained indoor parameters. The aim is to develop a novel universal model that is easy to use in a wide range of applications and easy to replicate. The presented predictive models are based on experimental data collected via affordable microclimate stations. They are built with Wi-Fi-enabled microcontrollers similar to Arduino, designed to monitor environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, human presence, atmospheric pressure, and carbon dioxide levels. The experimental data used to train and test the models are specifically collected for this analysis in a primary school classroom in Bialystok, Poland, through the homemade stations that gather data minute-by-minute. Linear and non-linear models include machine learning models such as SVM, random forest, decision tree, and neural networks. Among the various models tested, the random forest method, which relied solely on temperature, humidity, and human presence measurements, produced the most accurate results, achieving an R-squared value of 0.89. The use of temperature, humidity, and presence sensors, which are more affordable than CO2 sensors, highlights the novelty of the present analysis and the cost-effectiveness of predictive modelling in environmental monitoring. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Accurate solar radiation prediction leverages various machine learning techniques, with artificial neural networks (ANN) being the most common and precise due to their ability to detect and learn relationships between meteorological variables and solar radiation. Traditionally, training and deploying these models require high-capacity computers. However, the proliferation of low-power smart devices, such as embedded systems and mobile devices, necessitates exploring methodologies for implementing ANN on systems with limited computational resources. This paper proposes a quantized neural network model for solar radiation prediction, considering the hardware limitations of low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller. The methodology involves five stages: hardware and software selection, neural network development and quantization, microcontroller implementation, model validation, and result analysis. Experimental design allows detailed performance evaluation of quantized neural networks, demonstrating that the TensorFlow Lite Quantized Aware model is suitable for solar radiation prediction. Metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) of 44.24 and R2 of 0.96 indicate that the selected quantized model differs from the original non-quantized model by less than 0.5% in RMSE and 0.04% in R2. The study concludes that implementing quantized ANN models on microcontrollers is a technically and economically viable solution for solar radiation prediction. Quantization enables complex predictive models to run on low-cost, energy-efficient devices, thereby democratizing advanced prediction technologies for critical applications like solar energy generation. © 2025 Universidad de Santander.

	abstract = {This work presents a portable moisture content (MC) sensor, for tree hydration control, adopting a microwave self-oscillating antenna. The operating principle exploits the dependence of the oscillator nonlinear steady-state regimes on the dispersive load, represented by a patch antenna loaded by wood in different MC conditions. A novel read-out approach that eliminates radio frequency (RF) measurements and relies solely on the oscillator's steady-state dc bias conditions is proposed. First, a free-running oscillator, adopting a pseudomorphic highly electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) is designed in the 2.4-GHz band, with a 50-Ω load. The tuning capabilities are analyzed by nonlinear/electromagnetic (NL/EM) co-simulation, with the oscillator loaded by the dispersive patch-antenna impedances corresponding to different hydration conditions. A comprehensive experimental campaign of the fabricated prototype characterizes the wood sample. By tuning the HEMT bias voltages, distinguishable dc drain currents are retrieved and correlated with the wood's hydration state. These results are fully validated by an independent method based on the standard weighting procedure. Consequently, moisture monitoring can be conducted automatically by a low-cost microcontroller (μController) and the system can be adopted as a portable device for the proposed purposes. To enable the adaptivity to new unseen data and different MC scenarios, a low-computation machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed, enabling the system to operate in real time and as a stand-alone system.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In safety-critical applications, microcontrollers must be compliant with the required quality constraints and performance standards, particularly in terms of the maximum operating frequency (Fmax ). Machine learning (ML) models have proven effective in estimating Fmax by utilizing data extracted from on-chip ring oscillators (ROs), making them a valuable instrument for performance screening. However, the cost of obtaining labeled samples and the stringent accuracy needed by the model create hard challenges in this context. In order to address these, we explored three deep-learning (DL)-based key strategies: 1) semi-supervised learning with deep feature extractors: we leverage the abundance of unlabeled production data in a semi-supervised approach. Deep feature extractor models are employed to transform data into higher-dimensional spaces. These feature embeddings enable accurate performance prediction using simple linear regression, with a fraction of labeled data to reach baseline performances; 2) intrafamily transfer learning: when introducing new microcontroller products, with slightly different characteristics but the same set of ROs, previously trained deep feature extractors can be used, in a transfer learning fashion. This permits the use of significantly fewer labeled data compared to traditional methods; and 3) interfamily transfer learning: we extend the previous transfer learning concept to new microcontroller products with completely distinct characteristics. We aim to demonstrate that adapting the features set and fine-tuning DL feature extractors initially trained on specific legacy product data permits to yield better performance. Our research aims to provide a holistic framework for DL-based microcontroller performance screening to address the challenge of limited labeled data. The proposed methodologies significantly improve prediction accuracy and reduce the dependency on a large number of labeled samples, thus enhancing the efficiency and efficacy of ML-based microcontroller screening. The proposed framework enables models reuse, serving as a valuable baseline when new products are released.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

By integrating machine learning techniques, particularly GANs, our system aims to shift towards a more proactive approach. GANs not only enhance the dataset for training purposes but also improve the robustness of predictive models. This innovation allows for early detection of potential sensor failures and water quality anomalies, thereby enabling timely interventions. Moreover, the use of GANs helps in generating synthetic data that mimics real-world scenarios, further strengthening the system's predictive capabilities. This ensures that the models are well-equipped to handle diverse and unforeseen situations. Ultimately, this proactive methodology contributes to maintaining consistent water quality and preventing possible health hazards, fostering greater trust in water management systems.  © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To address the issue of difficulties in weighing yaks，a dynamic weight measurement algorithm based on GAN and BPNN is developed by integrating IoT and AI technologies. The STM32 microcontroller is used to acquire raw pressure sensor data from 80 yaks while the yaks are walking smoothly. Subsequently，3 000 pieces of fake data were generated using a GAN network，and regression prediction is performed using a BPNN neural network to achieve dynamic weight measurement of yaks. Under normal walking conditions， the position judgment is carried out by using the pair-projecting infrared devices，and using these for data collection. Then，collected raw pressure data were submitted to the prediction model for regression prediction. The experimental results show that resulting in an average weighing time of approximately 4 seconds per yak and the average absolute error between the predicted and actual weights of the yaks is 0. 92%. Surpassing the best accuracy（±5%）achieved by experienced technicians in weight estimation. The yak dynamic weighing algorithm based on BPNN and GAN can quickly obtain accurate and automated yak body weight data.

	abstract = {Aim: The current research explores the potential of machine learning predictive models in optimizing the storage conditions of tomatoes. This is achieved through Internet of Things (IoT) technology, sensors, cameras, and microprocessors integrated into refrigerators along the supply chain. Methodology: Controlling temperature and humidity inside the refrigerated container was accomplished by implementing the Arduino microcontroller and supplementary hardware components, including the ESP32 module relay, an advancement over the ESP8266 microcontroller. The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was used as software platform for this experimentation. Various parameters, including humidity, oxygen, carbon-di-oxide, and shelf life, were recorded at different temperatures and on different days. Subsequently, the collected data was analyzed employing machine-learning models to determine the most effective prediction model for these variables. Results: From the results it has been revealed that apolynomial of degree 4 is the best-fit regressor model for the data on humidity. Polynomials of degrees 2, 2, and 3 are the best models for the target variables oxygen, carbon-di-oxide, and shelf life. Interpretation: During analysis, This result suggests that different polynomial degrees are optimal for modeling different variables in the dataset.

One viable strategy for improving fire detection systems’ efficacy and precision is the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This article details research into the conception and development of an IoT, ESP32-based, Arduino MEGA-connected smart pre-alert detection system for fires. Because of its flexible nature, the Arduino microcontroller can easily exchange data with various sensors for real-time monitoring and analysis. This study surveys the existing literature to provide insight into many approaches to early fire detection (forecasting), such as sensor fusion methods and the use of the intelligence concept as a pre-predictor. The research highlights the need to set up sophisticated fire monitoring and alarm systems and to develop predictive models based on sensor data. This study illustrates how embedded systems via IoT technology and the ESP32 architecture may improve the efficiency and dependability of very early fire detection systems. This research adds to the expanding corpus of information that may be used to improve fire safety in contemporary settings.

	abstract = {Ultrasonic diagnostics is the earliest way to predict industrial faults. Usually, a contact microphone is employed for detection, but the recording will be contaminated with noise. In this paper, a dataset that contains 10 main faults of pipelines and motors is analyzed from which 30 different features in the time and frequency domains are extracted. Afterward, for dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are performed. In the subsequent phase, recursive feature elimination (RFE) is employed as a strategic method to analyze and select the most relevant features for the classifiers. Next, predictive models consisting of k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed. Then, in order to solve the classification problem, a stacking classifier based on a meta-classifier which combines multiple classification models is introduced. Furthermore, the k-fold cross-validation technique is employed to assess the effectiveness of the model in handling new data for the evaluation of experimental results in ultrasonic fault detection. With the proposed method, the accuracy is around 5% higher over five cross folds with the least amount of variation. The timing evaluation of the meta model on the 64 MHz Cortex M4 microcontroller unit (MCU) revealed an execution time of 11 ms, indicating it could be a promising solution for real-time monitoring. © 2024 by the authors.},

IoT in healthcare includes connected-health, smart-health, and mobile-health, enabling devices to share information for better care. Deep learning, particularly in medical imaging, shows promise for future medical applications. A recent study proposed a hybrid model using Stacked BiLSTM with Resnet50 Model and Adaswarm optimizer to classify medical disorders from five image datasets collected from consumer devices. These datasets, including COVID-19, Pneumonia, Malaria, lung cancer, and Brain Tumor, were employed to train the model. The dataset collected by sensors are sent to the cloud for sorting through a gateway. In this IoT framework, more consumer electronic products like microcontrollers and sockets are used in consumer devices. The proposed meta-heuristic algorithm-based model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99% with an average loss of 0.019.

	abstract = {Stress, as a reaction to threatening situations, can raise heart rate and result in serious conditions that might cause significant damage or even be life-threatening. Traditional methods for evaluating stress, which rely on subjective self-reporting and clinical assessments, often suffer from biases and inconsistencies. Artificial intelligence models have been explored to predict stress levels more accurately. This paper investigates the application of Extreme Gradient Boosting in classifying psychological stress using the WESAD dataset, which includes parameters such as acceleration, electrocardiogram, electromyography, electrodermal activity, temperature, and respiration. The dataset was balanced and sampled to create a manageable subset for experimental. Extreme Gradient Boosting was chosen for its efficiency and scalability in handling complex datasets. The model was trained and validated, achieving a 95% accuracy in predicting stress levels. This study highlights the potential of integrating Extreme Gradient Boosting models into wearable devices for real-time stress monitoring.

This paper focuses on the application of vibration signal analysis for SHM of lift motors using time series predictive model which enables the early detection of potential faults. Lift motors are subjected to various mechanical stresses, vibrations, and operational loads during their service life. In this work, velocity of the lift motor is acquired to monitor the vibration severity of the lift motor using Arduino Mega Microcontroller and Accelerometer MEMS (ADXL 345) based on the Vibration Assessment ISO chart 10816. Any vibration signal transmitted above the safety threshold will be labelled as an alert sign. It provides the maintenance team a warning signal where a further inspection is required. The acquired vibration signal is finally processed and analyzed using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for predictive analysis. The ARIMA model is capable of capturing the underlying patterns and trends in time series data, making it suitable for forecasting and anomaly detection in vibration signals. This paper highlights the use of ARIMA model as time-series predictive model.

	abstract = {The escalating impacts of climate change have no-tably increased the frequency and intensity of forest fires, presenting profound challenges to both environmental sustainability and socio-economic stability. Traditional wildfire management strategies, heavily reliant on suppression tactics, are increasingly inadequate due to their high resource demands and limited adaptability to rapid environmental changes. This study introduces an approach to wildfire detection by integrating advanced deep learning algorithms with practical hardware deployment. Utilizing the FLAME (Fire Luminosity Airborne-based Machine learning Evaluation) dataset, we develop a predictive model using lightweight deep learning architectures like MobileNetV2, EfficientNetBO, NASNetMobile, and ResNetV2101, which are optimized for real-time processing and low computational costs. We deployed this model on the cloud and we used an ESP32 microcontroller-based device equipped with a camera and servo motor, designed to autonomously monitor forest areas and provide immediate fire alerts. This integrated system not only aims to enhance early fire detection but also helps wildfire management to be more proactive and efficient. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technology to significantly reduce the time between fire onset and detection, thereby enabling quicker response times and reducing the overall impact of wildfires. Experimental results show that MobileNetV2 resulted in the best-performing model with a test accuracy of 98.1 %, and the device performed up to expectations in hands-on testing scenarios. This research contributes significantly to the fields of environmental monitoring and disaster management, providing a scalable and effective solution to a critical global challenge intensified by climate change. Our work underscores the potential of this technology to reduce the time from fire detection to response, thereby mitigating the impact of wildfires.  © 2024 IEEE.},

This research proposes a comprehensive air quality monitoring and prediction system. A study approach to the development of an extensive air quality monitoring and prediction system specifically designed for industrial environments is presented by this research. The incorporation of essential elements including the PIC Controller, MQ-135 sensor, buzzer, LCD display, microcontroller, and computer interface, in conjunction with machine learning techniques, characterizes an advanced strategy for air quality monitoring and prediction. The PIC Controller, which acts as the central processing unit for smooth data integration and orchestration, lies at the heart of this system.

	abstract = {This paper suggests a novel Model-Free Predictive Control (MFPC) approach for three-phase quasi Z-source inverters (qZSI). While Model Predictive Control (MPC) is popular for qZSI due to its ease of use and performance, it suffers from sensitivity to parameter mismatch. The proposed MFPC overcomes this limitation by relying on an ultra-local model (ULM), eliminating the need for precise parameter matching. This approach establishes a comprehensive mathematical model for key qZSI control variables, including load current, inductor current, and capacitor voltage. Additionally, a unique method seamlessly integrates shoot-through status into the MFPC framework without compromising qZSI operation. Simulation results across various operating conditions demonstrate how much better the suggested MFPC is than the traditional MPC, especially under parameter mismatch scenarios. Notably, the MFPC achieves a significant improvement, exceeding a 37% reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD). Furthermore, the practicality of the proposed MFPC strategy is validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing using a C2000TM microcontroller.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm where multiple clients are used to build the model without sharing data and preserving privacy. An FL-based linear regression model is designed to predict the length of stay for patients at hospitals using the low-power Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller unit (MCU). FL uses a distributed learning technique that allows model building from decentralized data sources. The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is a compact and energy-efficient MCU providing an ideal platform for implementing FL in resource-constrained environments. FL algorithms aggregate model parameters from multiple Arduino clients and collectively train and build a predictive model to estimate the length of stay at the hospital by patients. Experiments were conducted to understand the performance of FL on clients with data of equal and varying sizes and heterogeneous data from multiple sources. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Percentage Decrease in Training error (PDTE), and Percentage Difference with Optimal Testing (PDOT) value. Experimental results show that the number of local epochs and FL rounds affects the convergence of clients to the optimal value. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability of FL on low-power MCUs, preserving privacy which is a core requirement for healthcare solutions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

And also it proffers a comparison with modulated dual-voltage-vector (DVV) MFPCC in Reddy et al. (2022) to manifest the perquisite of the proposed model. This scheme presents a low complexity and an effective approach for candidate voltage vector selection, thereby reducing the burden of computation to a significant extent. Comparatively, the current errors and ripples associated with the existing DVV and TVV-MFPCC methods are lessened. Also, the time required for the calculation of the predictive current controller is minimized by first establishing the duty cycle's initial value to a constant value before performing the calculation. As a result, by depreciating a cost function, one can choose an ideal switching mode. Following this, the requisite duty cycle can be directly computed in the absence of any differential calculations by the propounded method in lieu of its initial value. Eventually, the experimental outcomes conducted using a Texas Instruments microcontroller TMS320F28379D, the same as in Reddy et al.

	abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is popular in applications with slow dynamics because of its advantages in handling constraints and multivariable optimization. But for aeroengines, it is difficult to obtain an exact prediction model, which will lead to offsets in tracking. Besides, deploying MPC to embedded controllers for real-time control is a well-known challenge. Therefore, this paper presents a switched linear MPC, which incorporates the augmented prediction models with error integrator for offset-free tracking, the sparse-based quadratic programming formula for solving MPC, and a reset strategy for achieving bumpless transfer at the switching instant. Further, on the hardware board we developed, six hardware-related acceleration strategies are explored and evaluated for real-time performance. Then, eight cases of five objects are tested, whose results indicate a significant speedup of around 50 times. At last, the hardware-in-the-loop tests of the turbofan engine and the real bench tests of the micro-turbojet engine are performed, which verifies the superiority, real-time performance, and potential for practical applications. Note to Practitioners - This paper was motivated by the problem of applying the offset-free MPC to the embedded control system for aeroengines. The difficulty of accurate modelling and the requirement to compute the embedded MPC in a limited time are two major challenges. Accordingly, we explore six hardware acceleration strategies that are often ignored to ensure the real-time performance. Moreover, we investigate the switched MPC to obtain the desired dynamic response. However, the controller switching tends to induce fluctuations that are harmful to the engine. Hence, we present a reset strategy to ensure bumpless transfer performance. Preliminary physical experiments suggest that the proposed approaches are feasible to achieve the predetermined objectives. Further, the comparisons with the previous methods highlight our superiority. Overall, this paper contributes to optimize the computational performance of microcontrollers and enhance bumpless transfer performance for MPC. In our future work, the proposed approaches will be applied to flight experiments and more industrial devices. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The security of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has always been a concern. The constantly changing IoV data under varying traffic conditions made it unsuitable for the IoV to adopt traditional anti-attack techniques. In the absence of protections, attackers can use in-car communication as a target to compromise the safety of passengers, hence the instancy to detect the security state of the IoV. However, currently available solutions require modifications to the original hardware of the IoV and are therefore very limited in applicability. In this paper, we propose a security assessment method for IoV based on Microcontroller Unit (MCU) chip temperature, called SAMCT. Specifically, we first record the MCU chip temperatures of IoV device in different security states and analyze the relationship between them. Second, the fingerprint dataset is built using the temperature residuals. Third, to forecast the security standing of IoV devices, an integration regression model based on Self-Encoders is suggested. Lastly, in order to facilitate the effectiveness of the SAMCT, a Cloud-Edge-End framework is designed with the technology of model adaptive partitioning. Results from the experiments, which were carried out on the Raspberry Pi 4B and Stm32 hardware platforms, demonstrate that the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the SAMCT is only 0.00104 and that the execution efficiency improvement under the Cloud-Edge-End framework is significant.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Monitoring and detecting abnormal events in cyber-physical systems is crucial to industrial production. With the prevalent deployment of the industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs), an enormous amount of time-series data is collected to facilitate machine learning models for anomaly detection, and it is of the utmost importance to directly deploy the trained models on the IIoT devices. However, it is most challenging to deploy complex deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on these memory-constrained IIoT devices embedded with microcontrollers (MCUs). To alleviate the memory constraints of MCUs, we propose a novel framework named Tiny Anomaly Detection (TinyAD) to efficiently facilitate onboard inference of CNNs for real-time anomaly detection. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of depthwise separable CNNs and regular CNNs for anomaly detection and find that the depthwise separable convolution operation can reduce the model size by 50%-90% compared with the traditional CNNs. Then, to reduce the peak memory consumption of CNNs, we explore two complementary strategies, 1) in-place; and 2) patch-by-patch memory rescheduling, and integrate them into a unified framework. The in-place method decreases the peak memory of the depthwise convolution by sparing a temporary buffer to transfer the activation results, while the patch-by-patch method further reduces the peak memory of layer-wise execution by slicing the input data into corresponding receptive fields and executing in order. Furthermore, by adjusting the dimension of convolution filters, these strategies apply to both univariate time series and multidomain time series features. Extensive experiments on real-world industrial datasets show that our framework can reduce peak memory consumption by 2-5× with negligible computation overhead.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Asthma affects an estimated 262 million people globally, with air pollution identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a major trigger for asthma attacks. Despite this, current solutions for monitoring air quality are often costly and not widely accessible, leaving individuals vulnerable and dependent on personal risk assessments.

These devices capture and report air quality data, offering users timely insights to evaluate their surroundings. Furthermore, the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to the data collected can enable predictive analysis, estimating the probability of an asthma attack based on current and historical air quality readings. This paper examines recent advancements in IoT-based air quality monitoring systems and predictive models for asthma risk assessment. By reviewing current methodologies and innovations in this domain, the paper seeks to clarify how IoT and ML technologies can be applied to support asthma management, bridging gaps in accessibility and empowering individuals with actionable health information.

As a foundation, the study implemented a regression model and correlation analysis on the field dataset to understand interdependencies of study variables, such as soil-moisture (SM), soil-temperature (ST), rain-precipitation (P), and environmental-temperature (T). The results obtained demonstrate a strong covariance and reliance of SM and ST on the P volume and the environmental temperature, respectively.

	abstract = {Low-cost air quality monitoring devices can provide high-density spatiotemporal pollution data, thus offering a better opportunity to apply machine learning (ML). Low-cost sensor nodes usually utilize microcontrollers as the main processors, and tinyML brings ML models to these resource-constrained devices. In this letter, we report the development of a low-cost air quality monitoring device with embedded tinyML models. We deploy two tinyML models on a single microcontroller and perform two tasks: predicting air quality and power parameters (using model predictor) and imputing missing features (using model imputer). The proposed model predictor can estimate parameters with a coefficient of determination above 0.70, and the model imputer effectively estimates the testing data when missing rates are below 80%. By performing the posttraining quantization technique, we can further reduce the model size but slightly degrade the accuracies.  © 2017 IEEE.},

It has been demonstrated that on-chip ring oscillators can be used as speed monitors to reliably predict the performances. However, any machine-learning (ML) model is likely to be inaccurate if trained on an inadequate dataset, and labeling data for training is quite a costly process. In this article, we present a methodology based on active learning to select the best samples to be included in the training set, significantly reducing the time and cost required. Moreover, since different speed measurements are available, we designed a multilabel technique to take advantage of their correlations.

In this letter, we investigate those forecasting algorithms to select the best one for different data measurements in a real-world setting, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2. Based on our results, the Holt-Winters methods were selected to forecast the temperature and CO2, and long short-term memory was used to forecast humidity. These models were then trained in the edge-scale servers to define their computational requirements and feasibility to be exported to a microcontroller.  © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Pelagic photosynthesis and respiration serve critical roles in controlling the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in seawater. The consumption and production via pelagic primary production are of particular importance in the surface ocean and in freshwater ecosystems where photosynthetically active radiation is abundant. However, the dynamic nature and large degree of heterogeneity in these ecosystems pose substantial challenges for providing accurate estimates of marine primary production and metabolic state. The resulting lack of higher-resolution data in these systems hinders efforts in scaling and including primary production in predictive models. To bridge the gap, we developed and validated a novel automated water incubator that measures in situ rates of photosynthesis and respiration. The automated water incubation system uses commercially available optodes and microcontrollers to record continuous measurements of DO within a closed chamber at desired intervals. With fast response optodes, the incubation system produced measurements of photosynthesis and respiration with an hourly resolution, resolving diel signals in the water column. The high temporal resolution of the time series also enabled the development of Monte Carlo simulation as a new data analysis technique to calculate DO fluxes, with improved performance in noisy time series. Deployment of the incubator was conducted near Ucantena Island, Massachusetts, U.S.A. The data captured diel fluctuations in metabolic fluxes with an hourly resolution, allowed for a more accurate correlation between oxygen cycling and environmental conditions, and provided improved characterization of the pelagic metabolic state. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Lead (Pb2+) is an important developmental toxicant. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) imports calcium ions using the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and also appears to mediate the influx of Pb2+ into the mitochondria. Since our environment contains mixtures of toxic agents, it is important to consider multi-chemical exposures. To begin to develop generalizable, predictive models of interactive toxicity, we developed mechanism-based hypotheses about interactive effects of Pb2+ with other chemicals. To test these hypotheses, we exposed HepG2 (human liver) cells to Pb2+ alone and in mixtures with other mitochondria-damaging chemicals: carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler that reduces MMP, and Ruthenium Red (RuRed), a dye that inhibits the MCU. After 24 hours, Pb2+ alone, the mixture of Pb2+ and RuRed, and the mixture of Pb2+ and FCCP caused no decrease in cell viability. However, the combination of all three exposures led to a significant decrease in cell viability at higher Pb2+ concentrations. After 48 hours, the co-exposure to elevated Pb2+ concentrations and FCCP caused a significant decrease in cell viability, and the mixture of all three showed a clear dose-response curve with significant decreases in cell viability across a range of Pb2+ concentrations. We performed ICP-MS analyses on isolated mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions and found no differences in Pb2+ uptake across exposure groups, ruling out altered cellular uptake as the mechanism for interactive toxicity. We assessed MMP following exposure and observed a decrease in membrane potential that corresponds to loss of cell viability but is likely not sufficient to be the causative mechanistic driver of cell death. This research provides a mechanistically-based framework for understanding Pb2+ toxicity in mixtures with mitochondrial toxicants. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Traditional methods of detecting water leaks from pipes can be highly time-consuming and may not provide real-time information, which is key to identifying leaks early and taking appropriate action. This paper is about to address these issues by developing an ultrasonic water leak detection system with real-time transmission of measured values. The proposed system uses ultrasonic transducers strategically placed in the water supply network to detect water leaks by measuring changes in ultrasonic signals. The measured values are processed and transmitted in real-time using a microcontroller with a wireless communication module that allows remote monitoring of the system. In order to increase the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the water leak detection system, this paper also incorporates machine learning techniques. The predictive models are integrated into the system, allowing it to proactively anticipate and alert on potential leaks before they develop into larger problems.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Malaysia has diverse agricultural activities due to its favourable climate, fertile soil, and abundant rain. The country produces various crops, including palm oil, rubber, cocoa, fruits, vegetables, and spices. The agricultural sector contributes to both domestic consumption and export market. Making agriculture more sustainable by integrating different technologies to enhance its operation is crucial for water-use efficiency. Malaysia has recognized the importance of sustainable agriculture practices to preserve the environment and ensure long-term productivity. Efforts are being made to promote sustainable farming techniques, including organic farming and agroforestry, while reducing the reliance on chemical inputs. Unfortunately, a large amount of water is wasted in agriculture today due to inefficient irrigation techniques. This research aims to highlight the contribution of the Smart Crop Watering System (SCWS) using the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensory system concerning the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the United Nations, specifically Goal 6 and Target 6.4. The study is based on a quantitative design and focuses on secondary data collection. The proposed SCWS prototype demonstrated that using the soil moisture sensor and Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller over a cloud environment can supply water to the crops adequately and appropriately. Further research should explore the potential for advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques in the smart crop watering system. Besides, the focus can be highlighted on incorporating algorithms and predictive models to optimize water usage, automate irrigation decision-making, and adaptively adjust watering schedules based on real-time data.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To encourage the good health and well-being sustainable development goal, this article presents the design and implementation of real-time indoor air quality index (AQI) prediction using an artificial internet of things (AIoT) electronic nose integrated into a vacuum cleaner robot. The objective of the proposed method is to implement an effective embedded AIoT solution utilizing sensor fusion and the TinyML framework for the purpose of strengthening the environmental health system with suitable current technology. The high-accuracy sensor outputs of total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), humidity, equivalent carbon dioxide (eCO2), and PM2.5 gathered as the dataset are normalized in the data pre-processing state and utilized to create trained models using dense neural networks (DNN) deep learning algorithms. Tiny machine learning is responsible for neural network training, as it is capable of executing AI algorithms on embedded devices with extremely low power consumption and limited RAM and ROM resources. The testing results demonstrate that the predictive model performed well, with 99% accuracy for a maximum absolute regression error less than 15 and an 18.33 mean square error. The embedded device implementation uses Wio terminals with ARM Cortex-M4F microcontrollers for real-time indoor air quality index prediction and visualization. Experimental results demonstrating the average precision of the indoor AQI prediction were obtained at an average accuracy of over 98% with a computation time of 10 milliseconds and an acceptable usage of ROM and RAM resources of 8.5 KB and 1.1 KB, respectively, along with successive performances that satisfied web application data virtualization using the internet of things (IoT). © (2023), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

However, despite considerable progress on tailored numerical methods for predictive control, the real-time implementation of predictive control and MPFC on small-scale autonomous platforms with low-cost embedded hardware remains challenging. While usual stabilizing MPC formulations lead to static feedback laws, the MPFC feedback turns out to be dynamic as the path parameter acts as an internal controller variable. In this paper, we leverage deep learning to implement predictive path-following control on microcontrollers. We show that deep neural networks can approximate the dynamic MPFC feedback law accurately. Moreover, we illustrate and tackle the challenges that arise if the target platform employs limited precision arithmetic. Specifically, we draw upon a post-stabilization with an additional feedback law to attenuate undesired quantization effects. Simulation examples underpin the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2023 EUCA.},

	abstract = {In this work we propose a method to detect turmeric adulteration using the Cavity Perturbation Technique (CPT) at 2.4GHz. Two different adulterants are examined (egg-yellow color and starch). We show that when a single adulterant is added, the resonant frequency and unloaded quality factor values follow clear trends as a function of added contaminant. Unfortunately, when the turmeric is adulterated with different concentrations of two adulterants (e.g., a 50% color/50% starch) CPT does not lead to good results. To address this, we also present an automated machine learning flow that dramatically enhances the adulteration detection. The proposed flow has the additional uniqueness that it optimizes the predictive model based on the selected target hardware platform doing technology independent as well as technology dependent model optimizations. Experimental results show that our predictive model can be optimized based on the accuracy required for different hardware platforms. In particular we target a microcontroller and a dedicated hardware implementation. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Medical specialists are primarily interested in researching health care as a potential replacement for conventional healthcare methods nowadays. COVID-19 creates chaos in society regardless of the modern technological evaluation involved in this sector. Due to inadequate medical care and timely, accurate prognoses, many unexpected fatalities occur. As medical applications have expanded in their reaches along with their technical revolution, therefore patient monitoring systems are getting more popular among the medical actors. The Internet of Things (IoT) has met the requirements for the solution to deliver such a vast service globally at any time and in any location. The suggested model shows a wearable sensor node that the patients will wear. Monitoring client metrics like blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, etc., is the responsibility of the sensor nodes, which send the data to the cloud via an intermediary node. The sensor-acquired data are stored in the cloud storage for detailed analysis. Further, the stored data will be normalized and processed across various predictive models. Among the different cloud-based predictive models now being used, the model having the highest accuracy will be treated as the resultant model. This resultant model will be further used for the data dissemination mechanism by which the concerned medical actors will be provided an alert message for a proper medication in a desirable manner. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {With upcoming technologies in farming and new varieties of seeds, it is a new challenge to adopt new ways of farming with changing climate conditions. So IoT gives us a new way to evolve with upcoming challenges. Production of crops is always influenced by the weather conditions; climate change has drastically changed the scenario. In new generation, new seed is evolved to get better yield, but they come with their own climate and water requirements. So in this work, we have tried to train the machine with the life cycle of the crop and make suggestion to the farmer with automated maintenance to maintain the environmental requirement of the crop at various stages of life cycle of the crop. The highlighting feature of this smart farming project is to maintain and meet the dynamic requirement of the crop and maintain the environmental condition based on the life cycle of the crop rather than making static threshold-based system. The farmer can check for new suggestions based on the growth of the crop which is directly proportional to the condition and height of the crop. Controlling of all these operations can be handled through any computer connected to Internet and connecting sensors with Intel Galileo 2. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The coupling of short wavelength electromagnetic (EM) interference to critical electronic systems in highly reverberant enclosures is a growing concern in the EM interference/compatibility community. In such highly reverberant cavities, prior research has shown that the induced EM fields, voltages, or currents can be modeled using the wave-chaotic random coupling model (RCM). The RCM partitions the interaction within the cavity into a universally fluctuating part, derived from random matrix theory, and a system-specific part, defined by the radiation impedance of the ports of interest, where the voltages or currents are induced. Earlier researchers have treated the radiation impedance as a time-invariant, frequency-dependent complex quantity. This is true for passive structures but is not true for active semiconductor devices, such as microcontrollers, which can exhibit time-varying radiation properties depending on the instruction cycle being executed at a given instant of time. The estimate of such a time-varying radiation impedance and its correlation with instruction cycles in an elemental microcontroller is the focus of this work. Utilizing clustering algorithms, we observe that the measured radiation impedance, as well as radiative emissions, are correlated to the class of instruction cycles being executed. By clustering the radiation impedance and emissions of the general-purpose input/output ports utilizing the class of instructions being executed, predictive models for microcontroller susceptibility can be derived even when detailed knowledge of the specific instruction cycle being executed is unknown a priori. Such a predictive capability can find multiple applications in the EMI/EMC community. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Several changes in manufacturing environments over the last decade have created obstacles in correctly identifying the root cause of the ECU failure. Semiconductor manufacturers have improved their production processes and introduced new equipment to reduce particle counts which therefore decrease chances of electrical failures within their parts. Meanwhile, Tier I manufacturers have increased the ECU design complexity to provide more functionality in the vehicle and also increased the severity of their testing to weed out these failures that would reach the OEM customer or consumer market. The increase in ECU design complexity has resulted in more functional semiconductors such as microcontrollers, and large storage flash memory devices. All of these factors have led to struggles in failure analysis of the ECUs that result in non-supplier related defects. Using the historical production and failure data, various predictive models are developed and tested to predict whether a failure in ECU testing results in a supplier defect or a non-supplier defect. With an 81% of accuracy rate, results shift the focus away from the semiconductor supplier for non-related defects and toward solving the root cause which may be occurring within the testing or manufacturing process. © 2022, ASM International.},

	abstract = {This article describes in more detail the issue of using predictive models of NAR neural networks to predict the course of certain quantities, which may indicate a problem with the industrial machines or their major failures. It is very important to find sufficient size of the structure and values of parameters that directly affect the output accuracy of the model. This article presents the way in which it is possible to automatically find the settings of these NAR models so that the required final accuracy metric is achieved. This presented algorithm was tested on simulation data samples collected by using the M5StickC microcontroller device. This collected dataset presented in this article contains accelerometer and gyroscopic data only, but there is a possibility to expand and add some other sensors to this microcontroller, to collect some other relevant data. This M5-StickC microcontroller device can be used for gathering data in the first phase of the machine state analysis without interfering with the mechanical construction and electrical connections of the machine. Testing of proposed algorithm was carried out in MATLAB environment. The article also describes the way in which these predictive NAR neural network models can be implemented directly in control systems, specifically PLCs from the manufacturer SIEMENS without the use of 3rd party analytical platforms. This application can be helpful in the area of predictive maintenance tasks, especially in avoiding critical failures of industrial machines and devices, or some of their specific parts. © 2022 by the authors.

In order to decrease the failure rates due to these obstacles, an environmental tracking system based on the IoT wireless sensor network (WSN) is needed. A complete system design is implemented using a wireless sensor network that utilizes LoRa technology to monitor important environmental parameters: temperature, humidity, CO2 level, and light intensity, present in multiple agricultural spaces. The system consists of three LoRa transmitters, which mark the location of each agricultural space, assembled with environmental sensors. Each transmitter is connected to an Arduino microcontroller that sends the gathered data to a LoRa receiver linked to a SIM7000E GSM module that in hand sends the data to a cloud server where it is visualized and later analyzed through a predictive machine-learning model. The collected data is visualized in graphical forms using a monitoring platform that offers real-time tracking of the environmental parameters. Finally, the data sets are extracted and imported into machine-learning software where they are analyzed using a predictive model that relies on supervised learning algorithms.  © 2022 IEEE.},

This is true not only for the integration of these difficult to predict sources in large power grids but also for small grids or standalone applications. The concept of edge computing, through the use of small, low power and inexpensive devices can help to make predictions more localized and feasible also in small size applications. In this article prediction methods based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) models are considered and compared, along with the possibility of reducing their cost in terms of memory and computational power requirements possibly without increasing prediction error. It is shown that quantization and pruning methods, implemented in the AI libraries of a common platform for Microcontroller programming, is a viable solution of this problem. Solar panel aging effects are also considered, and it is shown how the same system used for the prediction can be an indicator of reduced plant efficiency.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Waste management is one of the important factors which determine the health of an urban/rural area. Maintaining the surroundings clean and tidy in waste management becomes a tedious task for the government. To resolve this issue intelligent monitoring takes immediate effect on solid waste dust bins for making a green and safe environment. In this paper, a design of an intelligent smart-based waste management system (ISWM) with a predicted forecast is proposed. The proposed smart bin model uses ultrasonic, flame, gas, and accelerometer sensors these data is processed by the low power microcontroller called ESP-32. Initially, all the sensor data are processed by using ESP32 and statistical data is stored in the cloud. The proposed system consists of two parts the first step is a notification of the smart bin status to the user by the Global Internet of Things (GIoT) and secondly, smart bin sensor data is captured to form a dataset and the level of bin status in the dataset monitored and interpreted by using multivariate Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous (SARIMAX) model.

	abstract = {The lack of staffing during COVID-19 pandemic drives hospitals to expand their facilities in non-traditional settings to include centralized communication systems to monitor the vital signs of patients and predictive models to identify their health conditions. In this research, we have developed a microcontroller-based wireless vital signs monitoring system, which is able to measure the body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen level, respiratory rate and Electrocardiogram of the patients. We managed to obtain a reliable but more affordable vital signs monitor with high mobility that can be implemented in large hospitals. The system satisfies the design considerations of medical centers in terms of size, cost, power consumption and simplicity in implementation. The developed system consists of a set of wearable sensor nodes, wireless communications infrastructure with multiple communications techniques to carry vital data from the patients to the management system that handles the patient’s medical data, and a graphical user interface with a control system that enables the hospital staff to observe the status of all the patients and take the appropriate actions. The system was implemented using 40 sensor nodes, 4 distribution points and one gateway covering a hospital area of approximately 2500 m2. The system was tested and the measured percentage of lost packets is found to be less than 3.3% of those sent. During transmission, the current measured from the sensor node was 10.5 mA with a 3.3 V input voltage, which prolonged the operating time of the battery used. © 2021, IUPESM and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The growing worldwide population needs food, and traditional farming techniques are not efficient to feed everyone. In the modern farming era, hydroponics-based farming is both an efficient and go-to solution. There are six basic hydroponics: basic system, wick system, water culture, ebb and flow, drip system, and nutrient film technique (NFT). All kinds of hydroponics have one of the six or a combination of the six architectures. As hydroponics deals with water, factors related to water such as pH value and nutrients present are significant. Apart from this, oxygen in water directly deals with the nutrient intake factor of the plant. To maintain the pH value in water culture, we propose an algorithm that will automate the farming process and reduce the needed manpower. In the proposed system, data will be extracted from water using a pH electrode. Selected plant species will hold the pH value required to be maintained. A microcontroller will take input parameters such as the water balance in the tank and the pH value of the water. Data will be further fed into the algorithm, which will calculate the amount of acid or base required to dissolve in the water. In this system, we use acetic acid to maintain the pH factor. The proposed system will be adaptable in all types of hydroponics. Secondary factors such as when the plants have different growth phases that require different pH values will be maintained, which is also included in the proposed system. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The stator currents corresponding to the six modulated switching modes are predicted without relying on the motor's mathematical model nor parameters thanks to its model-free nature. To enhance the performance of the controller, adaptive current detection technique and current difference modification are employed, yielding good adaptation to the duty ratio modulations. Implementation of the proposed method is realized via a TMS320F28379D microcontroller on a testbed to assess its effectiveness.

The spectral information, measured in the range of 1.5–2.7 GHz, is elaborated on by an embedded predictive model, based on a partial least squares (PLS) regression tool, for the estimation of the soil moisture (%) in a real environment. The proposed system is composed of a waveguide, containing Tx and Rx antennas, and an electronic circuit driven by a microcontroller (MCU). It will be shown how the system provides a useful and fast estimation of moisture on a silty clay loam soil characterized by a moisture range of about 9% to 32% and a soil temperature ranging from about 8◦ C and 18◦ C. Using the PLS approach, the moisture content can be predicted with an R2 value of 0.892, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.0%, and a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 4.3. The results prove that it is possible to make accurate and rapid moisture assessments without the use of invasive electrodes, as currently employed by state-of-the-art approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The extraction of relevant wavelengths from a large dataset of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a significant challenge in vibrational spectroscopy research. Nonetheless, this process allows the improvement in the chemical interpretability by emphasizing the chemical entities related to the chemical parameters of samples. With the complexity in the dataset, it may be possible that irrelevant wavelengths are still included in the multivariate calibration. This yields the computational process to become unnecessary complex and decreases the accuracy and robustness of the model. In multivariate analysis, Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) is a method commonly used to build a predictive model from NIR spectral data. However, in the PLSR method and common commercial chemometrics software, there is no standard wavelength selection procedure applied to screen the irrelevant wavelengths. In this study, a new robust wavelength selection procedure called the modified VIP-MCUVE (mod-VIP-MCUVE) using Filter-Wrapper method and input scaling strategy is introduced. The proposed method combines the modified Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) and modified Monte Carlo Uninformative Variable Elimination (MCUVE) to calculate the scale matrix of the input variable. The modified VIP uses the orthogonal components of Partial Least Square (PLS) in investigating the informative variable in the model by applying the amount of variation both in X and y{SSX,SSY}, simultaneously. The modified MCUVE uses a robust reliability coefficient and a robust tolerance interval in the selection procedure. To evaluate the superiority of the proposed method, the classical VIP, MCUVE, and autoscaling procedure in classical PLSR were also included in the evaluation. Using artificial data with Monte Carlo simulation and NIR spectral data of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) fruit mesocarp, the study shows that the proposed method offers advantages to improve model interpretability, to be computationally extensive, and to produce better model accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.
